Websocket Chatting App
-----------------------

This App is developed as part of 'Websocket with eclipse jetty' discussion covered in my blog. The main focus was to develop server side frame work which can support any client with websocket implementation. At present I have developed browser based client with HTML5 websocket which is still under development and very frajile but still can be used to get you started.

STEPS TO DEPLOY
----------------

1) Download eclipse jetty from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">here</a>.
